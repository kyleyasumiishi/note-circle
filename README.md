# Note Circle

This repository contains my source code for an app I built to practice testing myself at calculating the number of semitones between different notes in the Note Circle.

I'm teaching myself to play guitar using the Justin Guitar website, and this exercise was suggested as part of the <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/modules/music-theory-1">Practical, Fast & Fun Music Theory course</a>.

Here is a link to the <a href="https://kyleyasumiishi.github.io/note-circle/">app</a>.
